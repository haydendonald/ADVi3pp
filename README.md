# A more custom version of the ADVi3pp firmware
This project aims to develop a more personal firmware for my 3D printer. 

### This project aims to
* Add support for a inductive probe sitting behind the extruder with [model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4297396)
* Add the ability to remove the boot screen
* Add support for power recovery (not sure if possible with the hardware)
* Add support for adjustments to the read auto leveling values (as my printer sends to miss read on one side)
* Add print left time on the print screen
* Make the print progress bar larger

### Features added so far
* Inductive probe
* Filament runout sensor

# Thanks

Thanks to [Dylan xKoldx](https://github.com/xKoldx/ADVi3pp-Marlin) and [weidercs](https://github.com/weidercs/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for their forks supporting BLTouch. Thanks to Matt Cowell [SureshotM6](https://github.com/SureshotM6/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for the fork supporting M600 and head parking.

Thanks to Leo LÃ¼ker (Silverquark) for his [i3plus+ project](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus). I take many ideas from his code. But the project is no more active and I do not like the screens (personal taste) so I have created the **ADVi3++** fork. It is technically a fork of Marlin, not of i3plus+.

Thanks to [MarlinTeam](http://marlinfw.org/) for their great work.
